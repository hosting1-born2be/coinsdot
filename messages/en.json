      "title": "Understanding How Crypto Wallets Work",
      "description": "Most people see a crypto wallet as “an app that holds your Bitcoin or Ethereum.” But the truth is more interesting: wallets don’t actually store coins. Instead, they store the keys that prove ownership of your funds on the blockchain. Understanding how a wallet functions will give you confidence in every transaction you make."

          "0": "When you open your wallet, you are essentially looking at an interface that manages two key components: your public address (where funds can be sent) and your private key (which serves as your proof of ownership). The private key never leaves the wallet, but it’s what signs every transaction you approve.",
          "1": "So, what happens when you decide to send crypto?",
          "2": "At this stage, the coins don’t “move” from one digital pocket to another. Instead, the blockchain updates its ledger: your balance decreases, and the recipient’s balance increases. Think of it as updating rows in a giant public spreadsheet that everyone can see."

By entering the transaction ID on a public explorer, such as blockchain.com, you can view when it was received, confirmed, and recorded in the blockchain. This transparency is what makes crypto unique compared to traditional banking."
